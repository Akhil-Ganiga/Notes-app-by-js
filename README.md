The Notes App is a web-based application that allows users to create, edit, and organize text-based notes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing notes. Users can add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes as needed. JavaScript handles the logic for storing notes locally or on a server, depending on the implementation. This application enhances productivity by providing a convenient platform for jotting down thoughts, ideas, tasks, and reminders, accessible from any device with internet access.
